This repository serves as a live copy of the /etc/puppet directory.  We'll
automate some basic infrastructure using Puppet while working together today.
Please follow along on the web or on your own laptop.

We're going to move quickly to write as much code as possible in the time we
have.  I hope pushing the code to GitHub as I write it live works well.

Ping me with any questions you may have after the meetup.

Also make sure to try out [Puppet Enterprise](http://puppetlabs.com/).  It's free for a small number of nodes and makes setting up Puppet ridiculously fast and easy.
